# IoT-PD-RPM

This repository aims to centralize and organize information about the developed software, the implemented classes, the hardware used, and other resources involved in the doctoral thesis in Computer Science entitled *IoT PD-RPM Approach: Promoting Adherence to Peritoneal Dialysis in the Internet of Things Scenario*.

## Hardware
### ESP32-CAM

The ESP32-CAM is a microcontroller module that combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity with an integrated camera, widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision projects. It is based on the ESP32 chip, which has sufficient processing power to run simple image algorithms, such as facial recognition and object detection, and allows image transmission over a network. Compact and low-cost, the ESP32-CAM is a popular choice for applications requiring real-time image capture and processing, such as remote monitoring, security, and automation.
